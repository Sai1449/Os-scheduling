Energy-Efficient OS Scheduling
This is a web-based simulation tool for comparing CPU scheduling algorithms with a focus on energy efficiency. It allows users to input tasks, select scheduling algorithms (FCFS, Round Robin, or Energy-Aware), and visualize energy savings and CPU usage over time.

Supports three scheduling algorithms:

1: FCFS (First-Come, First-Serve)

2: RR (Round Robin) with configurable quantum time

3: Energy-Aware Scheduling based on task priority

Dynamic task input
Visualization of:

1: Energy Saved per Task

2: CPU Usage Over Time

Displays start time, finish time, and energy saved for each task

Technologies Used: 

HTML / CSS

1: Tailwind CSS for styling

2: JavaScript for logic and DOM manipulation

3: Chart.js for data visualization

How to Run:

1: Download this project.html file.
2: Open this file in Vscode
3: Now run by open with Live server in vscode.
4: Enter tasks with arrival time, burst time, and priority.
5: Choose a scheduling algorithm.
6: Click "Run Scheduling" to see results and charts.

Mandatory:
1: Tailwind 
2: Node JS
3: Packages.
